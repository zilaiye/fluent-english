# Lawrence-Ferlinghetti's enduring San Francisco

## Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet , publisher , painter , social activist  and bookstore owner ,has been San Francisco's de facto poet laureate and literary Pied Piper for seven decades . He turns 100 this month , and the city is making preparations to celebrate him in style . Readings and performances and an open house will take place  at City Lights , the venerable bookstore he co-founded in 1953 . 

### de facto 事实上的，实际上的

### poet laureate  桂冠诗人

### Pied Piper  花衣魔笛手

### in style 以令人印象深刻的方式

### open house  接待日，开放日

### venerable   令人尊敬的，崇高神圣的

## City Lights is almost certainly the best bookstore in the United States . It's so dense with serious world literature of every stripe that it's a Platonic ideal . It can inspire something close to religious awe .

### dense  浓密的，密集的

### of every stripe 各类

### Platonic  柏拉图式

### ideal 理想，理想的事物

### religious awe 宗教信仰般的

## The store survived an obscenity trial in 1957 after its publishing arm issued Allen Ginsberg's revolutionary "Howl and Other Poems". The trial made Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti internationally famuous almost overnight.

### obsecnity  淫秽；下流的言行

### trial 审判，官司

### publishing arm 出版部门

### howl  嚎叫

## City Lights became a nerve center for the Beats and other writers. Allen Ginsberg , Jack Kerouac and other writers from that era were Easterners who dropped into San Francisco for a spell . 

### nerve center  神经中枢，核心

### the Beats 垮掉的一代

### dropped into 短暂停留

### spell 持续的一段时间

## If City Lights is a San Francisco institution , Ferlinghetti himself is as much of one . He has loomed over the city's literary life . As a poet , he's never been a critical favorite . But his flexible and plain-spoken and often lusty work - he has published more than 50 volumes - has found a wide audience . His collection " A Coney Island of the Mind" (1958) has sold more than 1 million copies , making it one of the best-selling American poetry books ever published . 

### institution 机构

### loom  隐约显现

### critical 评论性的，评论界的

### plain-spoken 直言不讳的，坦率的

### lusty 精力充沛的，强而有力的

### volumes 书，一卷，一册

## enduring 持久的，持续的
