Disney released the first teaser for director Niki Caro’s upcoming live-action remake of the 1998 animated film Mulan on Sunday. So far, so typical for the studio behemoth, which rarely misses a marketing trick. But this time there’s a twist, because the live-action Mulan has a surprising advantage over the rest of Disney’s live-action remakes: It looks good.

behemoth 庞然大物，强大的事物

twist 变化

First of all, this is a spectacularly well-made trailer. The opening is not that different from most trailers. But after that first fade to black, we get something that probably won’t be in the theatrical version of Mulan: a montage.

spectacularly  极其地，非常地

montage  蒙太奇手法，蒙太奇式的剪辑

theatrical  戏剧的，电影的

The gradually-accelerating action sequence montage is a trailer cliché, but this is executed flawlessly, down to the little “It is my duty to fight” epilogue slowing the pace as efficiently as a brake run on Space Mountain to give the audience time to catch its breath before the title. It’s a spectacular trailer for what looks like it might be a good movie.

cliche  陈词滥调，老生常谈的想法

excuted  执行，实施

flawlessly  炉火纯青的

epilogue 收场白，后记

space mountain  飞越太空山

brake run  刹车，制动器



Mulan is a story with set pieces that are better suited to live-action than animation, and a heroine whose feats are more impressive if we see an actual human body performing them, whatever wires or special effects are involved behind the scenes. This feels less like Disney’s other cash grabs and more like a story finally landing in the appropriate medium.

set pieces  具有众所周知的固定形式的文学，艺术作品的片段

suited  合适的，适宜的

feats  英勇事迹，壮举

cash grab  设计出来主要是为了赚取利润的产品
