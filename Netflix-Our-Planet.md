# Netflix's Our Planet says what other nature series have omitted 

## Onscreen eagles lock talons in aerial combat , and humpback whales engulf herring by the shoal . Birds of paradise , hunting dogs , leafcutter ants - they ar all tehre . This is OUr Planet - Netflix's new , big-budget nature doucmentary -and , without hte sound on , viewers could easily think that they 're watching Planet Earth III.

### onscreen  在屏幕上

### eagles 老鹰

### talon  利爪

### aerial空中的

### engulf  吞没，吞噬

- the flames rapidly engulfed the forest . 火焰迅速吞没了森林

### shoal 鱼群

### big-budget   巨资

## The resemblance to the oeuvre of the BBC's renowned Natural History Unit is striking. But this time , the messages delivered by that familliar voice are different . Here , much of the awe is tinged with guilt , the wonder with concern , the entertainment with discomfort . 

### resemblance  相似之处

### oeuvre  全部作品，作品全集

### be tinged with  使略带。。。情感

- the music is tinged with sorrow and bitterness.  

### discomfort  不安

## Repeatedly , unambiguously , and urgently , Our Planet reminds its viewers  that the wonders they are witnessing are imperiled by human action. After seeing a pair of mating fossas - a giant , lemur-hunting, Madagascan mongoose - we're told that the very forests we just saw have since been destroyed . 

### unambiguously  不含糊的

### urgently 急迫的

### imperil  危及，使陷入危险

### mate  交配

### fossas  马岛猛

## It does what no other natural-history documentary has done . It forces viewers to acknowledge thier own complicity in the destruction of nature , in the moment . It feels sad , but also right . 

### complicity  同谋，共犯

## That's not to say that Our Planet is a dour, finger-wagging downer - far from it . It is hard not to cheer as an initially incompetent Philippines eagle takes her first flight , or laugh as a tree shrew uses a pitcher plant as a toilet , or marvel at two Arabian leopards meeting and mating - 1 percent of the species' surviving individuals , perhaps  creating a few more . Most of the series is still joyful , but it is never allowed to be naively so . 

### dour  冷峻的，阴沉的

### finger-wagging  斥责的，警告的

### eagle  鹰

### pitcher plant  猪笼草

### marvel at  惊叹

### leopards  豹

## omitted 忽略
