# Regional Discrimination

## Many chinese suffer discrimination based on their  regional origin

## Urban Chinese are often contemptuous of internal migrants , wherever they are from . But people from  certain regions suffer higher than usual levels of negative stereotyping . Regional discrimination  " is hard to see and touch " yet its impact is as painful as getting "a bloodeid  face" , said an academic quoted by a north-eastern newspaper . 

### contemptuous   轻蔑的，鄙视的

### stereotyping 对。。。形成模式化的看法；对。。。有成见

## People from Henan and the north-eastern provinces of Heilongjiang,Jilin and Liaoning are amongth those most commonly targeted , partly beacause those areas are such big sources of migrants,. Henan is a farming province of about 100m people . The latest census , in 2010 , showed that 7.5% of Henanese  were living outside their home province , the second-highest proportion of any province . The highest was Anhui , on Henan's eastern border .

### census  普查，调查，统计，人口普查

## Egregious examples of regional stereotyping occasionally cause outcry.In 2017 , an internet conglomerate known for its food-delivery app admitted to excluding applicants from certain reions for  an open position. The company later apologized . After the incident, many locals and some sympathisers elsewhere  vowed to show their displeasure by deleting the mobile app of the firm .

### outcry  呐喊，疾呼，强烈抗议

### open position 空缺职位

### sympathisers 支持者，信奉者

## Some lawyers say a  legal loophole is partly to blame . China's employment law prohibits discrimination on grounds of ethnicity , sex, religion , disability , socal background and health . Regional origin , however , is not mentioned . Some legal scholars and legislators have called for a wider law that would prohibit all kinds of unfair discrimination , including the region-based sort .

### ethnicity 民族

### on grounds of  以。。。为由

### legislators  立法者
