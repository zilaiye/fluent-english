## Guardian 卫报 

## Natre Dame  巴黎圣母院

## It  feels as though the very heart of France and the soul of Europe have been suddenly and viciously ripped out.  The fire that coursed through large sections of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris on Monday evening was an act of blind and terrible destruction that causes a great stab of emotional pain to us all .

## The file struck quickly and seemingly uncontrollably . It gathered force with immense power and ferocity , engulfing much of the roof and the central spire as  it caught hold . After an hour or so , the Paris fire brigade was able to begin to get part of the fire under some degree os control and to pertect the parts of the cathedral that may survive . As night fell , the great west towers still tood against the sky , proud but vulnerable .

## The cathedral will rise again in time . This terrible fire is not an event that should be trivialised or banalised . We stand with France in its hour of heartbreak . We will never ,ever ,turn away .
