# cheating men

## Cheating men  can be spotted by their face type , study suggests .

### spot  认出来

## Philandering men have unfaithfulness written all over their faces , according to research that suggests  men and women are able to spot cheating chaps just by looking at them .

## Experts found men with more "masculine" faces were more likely to be thought to be unfaithful , and such men also self-reported more cheating or "poaching" of other men's partners.

### masculine  男子气概的，雄性的

### poaching  偷猎，偷捕，挖走

## The team said being suspicious of men with masculine features - such as a strong browridge , strong jaw and thinner lips - might have offered an evolutionary advantage , allowing heterosexual women to spot a flaky partner and men to recognise a potential rival who might seduce their partner or leave them raising someone else's child .

### browridge  眉骨

### jaw  下颚

### flaky  可疑的，不靠谱的

### seduce  诱奸，勾引

## Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science , researchers described  how they asked heterosexual white participants  to judge the facial features of 189 white adults who had been photographed and taken part in previous research .

## The results showed men and women as a whole  gave higher scores of unfaithfulness to the images of men who had self-reported more cheating or poaching .

## When the team examined what  about the men's faces might have offered clues to their unfaithfulness , they found the standout feature was how masculine the face appeared . 

## Dr Krristen Knowles , an evolutionary psychologist from Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh , who was not involved in the study , said it was interesting the research made a clear  connection between perceptions of infidelity and actual infidelity . 

## But Knowles stressed it should not be assumed that men with masculine faces  were likely to be unfailthful . " We should be aware that these behaviors are incredibly complex , and are likely to be influenced by many factors , including socail and cultural effects , personality , genetics and life experiences,"  she said .
