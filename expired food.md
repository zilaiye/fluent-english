## The truth about expired food : how best-before dates create a waste mountain 

### expired  到期，期满，结束

### best-before  date 保质期

## would you eat a six-month-old yoghurt ? This is a question you may have aqsked if you read the recent story about a US grocer and his year-long experiment eating expired food .

## It started in October 2016 , when Scott Nash , founder of the Mom's Organic Market chain of grocery stores , wanted to make a smoothie .  He likes his with yoghurt . As he was at his holiday cabin in Virginia, though , the only pot he had to hand was one he had inadvertently left behind on his last trip there , six months earlier ., He opened it . No mould , no smell . He decided to take the plunge and dumped the yoghurt in the blender . "I drank and waited,"  he wrote on hist blog . And nothing happened.

### inadvetently 无意间的，不经意间的

### mould 霉菌

### take the plunge 果断行使，依然决定

### blender  搅拌机

## The first thing to point out is that Nash is based in the US , where regulations on food dating differ significantly from those in the UK . While British foods carry just one date -- either "use by" or "best before"  -- Nash was confronted by "expiration , use by , best by , sell by , best if used by ..." He sells food for a living , and even he doesn't understand the system .

### dating 注明日期，写上日期

### confront 面对，面临

## Clearly , this lack of clarity has implications for both the health of the environment and the health of the nation . What you don't eat , you'll end up binning , even if you could have safely eaten it ; and what you don't know not to eat could make you sick . A joint  report from the Natural Resources Defense Council and Havard Law School in 2013 said that 40% of American food goes uneaten each year , and the disorienting effect of the US date labelling system is in large part to blame .
